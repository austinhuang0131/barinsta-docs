## A note on Addiction

> "Using this app makes you realize the official app really is engineered in a specific way to encourage certain behaviours."

One of the merits of the app is anti-addiction. It was not intended in the early stage (as these addicting features were not implemented due to my lack of skills), but eventually I resonated with this anti-addiction ideal. And it does make sense.

| Actions | Official app | Barinsta |
| :-----: | ------------ | -------- |
| First screen | Feed, if logged in. Otherwise, you'll be prompted to sign up. | Your own profile (by default, configurable), if logged in. Otherwise, a blank page. |
| Liking/Saving in feed | You can double-tap (or use the heart button) to like the post. You can also save it by tapping the bookmark. | For each post, you must open it to find the Like/Save button. |
| Seeing liked posts | Complicated: Open your own profile, then Settings, Account, Posts you've liked... And there's a limit of 300. | Effortless: A distinct "Liked" button exists on your own profile. Seems to be limitless? |
| Viewing stories | Stories will display one-by-one like a slideshow. No interaction required. However, you have to hold the screen in order to take more time reading the story. | You must swipe to see the next story. You can view stories at your own pace, meaning you can pause for as long as you want. |
Timed "raven" messages | Viewing restriction applies (no replay or one replay). 1 day expiry applies. | Restrictions are ignored, plus you can download. However, 1 day expiry still applies. |

Therefore, I could say that Barinsta is designed for you to be conscious over what you do. Specifically, when you hit that "like", you should actually like that post, not because Facebook made you like that post. You also have a chance to review your actions, and the ability to download makes you cherish what you truly like, without being always hungry for content. Also, interaction being minimized means less logging, and Facebook wouldn't so easily push personalized content to you.
