* Public: [GitHub issues](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/instagrabber/issues): Log in, click "New issue", then "Ban Report - Get Started".
* Private: Email `im [at] austinhuang [dot] me` (NOT the support email address), and fill in [this format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinhuang0131/instagrabber/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ban_report.md).

See [here](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/instagrabber/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22BAN+REPORT%22) for a list of all public ban reports.
