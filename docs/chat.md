[![Matrix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matrix-%23Barinsta:matrix.org-000000?logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#barinsta:matrix.org) [![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-@Grabber__App-2CA5E0?logo=telegram)](https://t.me/grabber_app) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-YtEDzN2-7289da?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/YtEDzN2)

The above chatrooms are bridged together by [t2bot](https://t2bot.io/).

## Rules

1. These rules extend common community rules: No spam, no ads, no NSFW, etc.
2. [We're all adults.](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC) I expect respect and basic decency.
3. [Don't ask to ask, just ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/)
4. [Don't just say "Hello" in chat.](https://www.nohello.com/)
5. On Telegram, we use [Group Butler Beta](https://github.com/group-butler/GroupButler) for automated moderation. The bot could be a bit strict, so if you're accidentally muted, let @austinhuang know.
6. No crash dumps. Please report them [to GitHub](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/barinsta/issues/) or by email.
7. We're not going to hack a private account for you.
8. Off-topic conversations are allowed, but they must give way to any Barinsta-related discussion if one is happening.
9. The Developers reserve the right to perform any necessary actions.

## Note

The current Developers does not use `#suggest` and `#bug`, so try getting rid of the habit of doing so, and report them on GitHub instead.
