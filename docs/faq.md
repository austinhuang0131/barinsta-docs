## Basics

!!! Note
    Unless specifically instructed by this documentation or the developers, clearing application data/cache will not resolve issues.

### Should I use this app?

!!! Note
    This app is not a mod of the existing Instagram app (therefore not dependent on "version numbers") and is intended to function as a standalone app. However, you can still use "Share to..." in the options menu of a post, then choose "Direct Download" with the Barinsta icon. This works for private posts as well, as long as you're logged into the same account on Barinsta. (But honestly, if you don't post, you should just ditch the official app.)

Intended to replace the existing Instagram client (which is bloated, proprietary, and full of tracking) as well as other Downloader apps (sketchy, aren't they?), you will find this app useful if your Instagram use mainly constitutes the following:

* Viewing posts from your favourite accounts, hashtag, or location (log-in not required)
  * Alongside following accounts, this app allows you to have a personal "favourite" list in the app, without the need to log in!
* Viewing and interacting with stories
* Interacting (like, "save", comment) with posts
* Managing followings/followers
* Send DM to existing threads, texts or images
* Downloading contents (log-in not required)

This app also has the following merits:

* Open source software under GPLv3. The [source code](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/instagrabber) tells you exactly what you're running.
* No ads. No sketchy stuff.
* More privacy friendly. Specifically: No background processes without consent, no tracking scrolls, etc.
  * Option to view stories and DM anonymously (i.e. not sending "seen").

However, currently (but planned for the future), you cannot use this app to:

* Create group DM threads
* Create posts and stories

### Using VPN or proxies

!!! Warning
    Instagram is known to block IPs that are detected to be VPS/cloud providers or proxies.

    Therefore, **you're strongly advised AGAINST using Barinsta with VPNs or proxies.** (This does not include local VPN interfaces that does not connect to an external server.)

    **Do NOT attempt to log in on banned IPs.** Your account will be either locked until you provide a phone number, or banned with no recourse.

Instagram believes blocking IPs will stop spambots, but we all know they're just hungry for tracking. Again, Barinsta can only do *so much* to protect your privacy, and if you don't want Zucc to look into your life, you need to cut every single Facebook product, which is incredibly difficult for many (especially for the author, who is in North America, and cutting them will risk losing contacts).

Bibliogram, on the other hand, actually allows you to access Instagram contents (public profiles only) without connecting to Facebook. However, Instagram is working hard to render it unusable, so unfortunately, [it will probably stop working soon](https://lists.sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram-announce/%3C20201218014302.855fa8a816be2f19da2f56e3%40disroot.org%3E).

### F-Droid

For publishing a release on F-Droid, it goes through three processes, all of which can be monitored, but none of which are within my control.

1. Pick up new versions: This happens everyday and can be monitored through [commit history of our metadata file on F-Droid's GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/commits/master/metadata/me.austinhuang.instagrabber.yml).
2. Build new versions: This happens every 1~5 days and can be monitored through [edit history of our build information on F-Droid's wiki](https://f-droid.org/wiki/index.php?title=me.austinhuang.instagrabber/lastbuild&action=history).
3. Deploy: This happens 12~72 hours after build finishes for all updated apps, but there are occasional outliers. This can be monitored through [edit history of the page "deploy" on F-Droid's wiki](https://f-droid.org/wiki/index.php?title=deploy&action=history), [reddit r/FDroidUpdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/FDroidUpdates/), as well as [F-Droid's official chatrooms](https://f-droid.org/en/about/#contact).

People who use F-Droid clients will be able to update at Step 3, however it will not reflect on the F-Droid website until another day after.

### Device Compatibility

If you use a different ROM/OS that is compatible with Android, please refer to respective documentations regarding which Android version it is compatible with.

* **Android 4.4 or earlier:** Not supported due to [lack of TLS 1.2](https://github.com/square/okhttp#requirements), which can be a security vulnerability.
* **Android 5.0 or later:** Supported.

Generally, this app is tested on an Android 9 hardware and an Android 10 emulator. Although most design components use `androidx.appcompat` which should improve compatibility, certain Java methods may be supported differently among versions. [Compatibility issues](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/barinsta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acompatibility) will be attempted to be fixed as they're being reported, but without guarantee.

## Using Barinsta anonymously

Only these contents can be viewed without login:

* Public profile\*, hashtag, and location pages
* Post details (media, caption, like count), comments, comment likes\*\*

\* Including face-tagged posts, but excluding HD avatar and followers/followings.

\*\* Although possible to view in this app, you should avoid it due to a much stricter ratelimit.

### The app was working but now it doesn't show anything!

You might have hit the [ratelimit](https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram-docs/tree/master/docs/Instagram%20rate%20limits.md). Wait a few hours before opening the app again.

### Can we have an anonymous feed?

It is still being debated upon. However, such feature, if implemented, will carry heavy restrictions.

### Can we see stories?

!!! Note
    Please note that logging in doesn't mean the authors know you have seen it. This is controlled by a separate setting, visible when logged in.

Viewing stories absolutely requires an account, and online story viewers either...

* Have their own accounts (which can be banned by Instagram), or
* Ask for your login cookies (which defeats its purpose), or
* Generate URLs, ask you to click them when logged in, and return the body (which also defeats its purpose)

Since [the death of storiesig](https://twitter.com/jlobitu/status/1305929897169346560), anonymous story viewers that uses the first method became increasingly unreliable, therefore it is effectively impossible to view them without logging in.

## Using Barinsta with an account

* [Is my password safe?](#Is-my-password-safe)
* ["Suspicious login"](#"Suspicious-login")
* [I can't load anything after login!](#I-can't-load-anything-after-login)
* [Can I have the feed rearranged on every refresh?](#Can-I-have-the-feed-rearranged-on-every-refresh)

### Is my password safe?

Yes. Only your login cookie is stored in the app, which you can either remove in the app's account selector (long press), or revoke in your Instagram login activity settings. See [here](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/barinsta/blob/master/app/src/main/java/awais/instagrabber/activities/Login.java) for how the app handles login. TLDR: We do not store your password.

### "Suspicious login"

Logging in from Barinsta can be considered "suspicious". If so, please check the time and the location of the login (These should be accurate) and confirm the login from browser.

Remember: We don't steal your login info. Well, we can't do that anyway, or F-Droid would never forgive us.

### I can't load anything after login!

* Try logging in again by adding the same account.
* Logging in from account selector? Even though we provide some sort of multi-account login, Instagram may revoke cookies at any time. Note that your login entry will be overridden with the new cookie once you have fixed it, as long as the user ID stays the same.
* Do you need to [confirm a login](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/barinsta/issues/73)?

### Can I have the feed rearranged on every refresh?

That would require us to implement tracking (tell Instagram what posts you saw), which is a big no-no. Also, this measure prevents you from constantly refreshing the feed for new posts, which helps wellbeing. (On a side note, seriously, just don't follow thousands of accounts on Instagram. You're just gonna intentionally get yourself addicted.)

### Comparing followers and followings

Generally speaking, the feature works best if the sum of follower and following count (including duplicates) is under 1000. Going upward, the app will take significantly more time to compare them (since the user lists are paginated), but it should still work (The dev has tested ~5000).
